# Hi there 👋 I’m Ximena Lisouski.

I’m a **Data Scientist** driven by curiosity, creativity, and a passion for solving real-world problems through data.

📊 **Data Scientist | Actuary | Predictive Modeling | Data Analysis**

🎯 I’m passionate about creating data-driven strategies through machine learning and creative problem-solving.

💡 I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and advanced analytics techniques.

📈 Over the past several years, I've helped businesses turn data into strategic decisions by combining rigorous analysis with simple, effective, and creative solutions.

🏢 I started my career as a Data Scientist at Nosis, one of Argentina’s top credit bureaus, where I helped build the analytics and machine learning department, leveraging large-scale data to generate business value.

📡 Currently, I work in the **telecommunications industry**, developing predictive models and machine learning tools to optimize business processes. 

👩‍💻 As a **freelancer**, I design dynamic dashboards and automated reports that clearly communicate key business insights. I’m known for solving complex problems in a simple, strategic, and communicable way, powered by strong Python and SQL skills.

🚀 Always learning, always building solutions that make life easier for decision-makers.
